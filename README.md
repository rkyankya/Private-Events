# Associations
Microverse Ruby on Rails Project No.7 [Associations]

In this project, you will build an application named Private Events and that behaves similar to Eventbrite. The main goal is to put in practice the main concepts of Associations in rails.: [Full task description](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations.)


# Setup
You can setup this project by;
#### Either Cloning it
git@github.com:rkyankya/Private-Events.git
#### Or downloading the Zipped file from
https://github.com/rkyankya/Private-Events.git

## Before you start


- Remember to run `bundle install` in your terminal. In case of an error run `bundle update`.
- Run `bundle` after to verify all is well
- Run `rails db:drop` to reset the schema
- Afterwards, run `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate` on your terminal.
- Finally run `rails db:seed` to generate data for the tables
- Run `rails server` to start the sever `localhost:3000`
- We have a cool gem! To use it, run the rails console typing "rails c" in your terminal and when it loads type in the first line "Hirb.enable", it will return true if everything is working. Now you can see the tables of the database!
